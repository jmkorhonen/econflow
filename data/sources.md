# Data sources & provenance

Every empirical and policy parameter in `finland-baseline.ts` references a key
below. The rule: **no number without a traceable source and a plausible range.**
Ranges are deliberate — `empirical` ranges encode measurement uncertainty,
`policy` ranges encode the span of the live debate (a lever you set), and
`identity` values are exact accounting must-holds.

## Calibration anchors (validation targets, not inputs)

- **Equivalised disposable-income Gini ≈ 0.266** (Eurostat, 2023). The model
  reports `disposableGini` (adults, un-equivalised in P1) as the comparable figure.
- **Top-10% net wealth share ≈ 52%** (Statistics Finland, 2023) — target for the
  wealth proxy once P3 adds real accumulation dynamics.

## Known caveats (kept visible, not hidden)

- P1 does **not** equivalise income by household, so `disposableGini` runs a few
  points above the Eurostat figure; it is a calibration guide, not a published claim.
- Independent sampling across empirical ranges can produce incoherent worlds
  (e.g. high union density with high wage dispersion). Correlation structure is
  out of scope for the first uncertainty pass — documented, not assumed away.
- The wealth metric is a crude proxy until P3; treat top-share figures as
  illustrative for now.
